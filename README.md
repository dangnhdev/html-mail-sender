# Project Description
All email sent by a email marketing client will go to Gmail’s Promotion tab. And it decrease user’s open rate a lot. So I was develop a email client that can send HTML email over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, help user send a HTML email and it will go to Primary tab, not Promotion tab.
